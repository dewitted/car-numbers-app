# car-numbers-app
A simple MEAN stack CRUD app - please view the README file for instructions on how to start it.

In order to run the app locally, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone the main branch of car-numbers-app/ to your computer.
2. Navigate your terminal to the "frontend" folder and run the command "npm install".
  2.1 Run the command "ng serve" ("sudo ng serve" if you're on MAC) - this will start the front-end server on "http://localhost:4200/".
3. Navigate your terminal to the "backend" folder and run the command "npm install".
  3.1 Run the command "npm run dev" - this will start the back-end server.

4. Open http://localhost:4200/ on your browser and view the app! Thanks!


***Please note that since this is a MEAN stack app, it requires MongoDB to be installed beforehand and running for the back-end to work! :)

*Dev Note
I was able to put in most of the work in, however was cut short on time and did not implement any meaningful unit tests. As I'm interested in learning more about Jasmine and Karma,
I will probably be going to continue this app on another branch in my repository here for unit testing later. Please use the main branch of this repository.
